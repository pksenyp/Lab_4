# Laboratory work: Class Composition.
1. Develop a container class to store a collection of objects in your subject area. Implement the following container class methods:
* constructor and destructor;
* add a new element;
* deleting an item from the collection;
* loading from a file and writing to a file;
* display the contents on the screen;
* searching for data in the collection according to your individual assignment.

2. Place the container class in a separate program module. In module's header file (*.h) place class declaration, in implementation file (*.cpp) place class methods definitions.

In the main program module:
* create an instance of a container class;
* fill the container with data from a text file;
* output the container contents on the screen;
* demonstrate the execution of additional functions from your task.
